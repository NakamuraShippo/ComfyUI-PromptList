## Usage
![node](https://github.com/NakamuraShippo/ComfyUI-PromptList/blob/main/images/node1.png)  
Right-click on the workspace -> Add node -> prompt -> Prompt List to add the node.  
  
The node has the following inputs:  
selection: List of prompts registered in prompts.yaml, outputs the prompt of the selected item.  
  
If the following items are filled, the prompt from selection will not be output, instead the input prompt will be output:  
Prompt Name: New prompt name or name of prompt to update  
Positive Prompt: Content of positive prompt  
Negative Prompt: Content of negative prompt  
  
The input prompt name and prompts are saved in prompts.yaml.  
Also, if you change the prompt using the same Prompt Name, it will overwrite the prompt in prompts.yaml.

### prompts.yaml format  
```yaml
test:
  positive: positive prompt
  negative: negative prompt
...
```
   
## Notes
